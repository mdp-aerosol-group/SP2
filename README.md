# SP2
A small Julia package to read the binary files generated by the SP2 data acquisition system. The data uses the ```read_sp2``` python code from the [PySp2](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/PySP2) project and returns the data as a named tuple.

# Usage
```julia
using SP2

data = SP.read(file)
```

The Julia python distribution requires installation of associated dependencies.
